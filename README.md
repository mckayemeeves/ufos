# UFOs
## Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for muliple criteria at the same time. We accomplished this by creating javascript functions that can loop through the data to build the table and create the customized dashboard. Additionally, table filters have been added for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Results

Users can use the "Filter Search" function as shown below in order to narrow down their results

One does not need to enter all the filters. For example, if a city is typed in, it will show all the reported sightings from that one city. In the example below, we searched "Spring Valley."

Deleting state or shape will update the table according to the criteria
## Summary
- One drawback of the new design
    - Unfortunately, the search field is case-sensitive. I was puzzled when I would type in city and nothing would show up. I realized that I needed to change the case on my entry in order to get a result
- Recommendation for further development
    - In order to improve the users experience, I would add an "enter" button so that users can visually click something in order to get results. 
    - I would also add more current data like a section to pull live data. This would allow users to see the most recent reported sighting which would help raise intrigue among users.
